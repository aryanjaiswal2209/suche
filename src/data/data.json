  "About": {
    "paragraph1": "Suche is an executive search firm which came into existence due to the challenge of finding right talent in Indian Wealth Management Industry. Senior talent seeks a lot of information before making a decision to even meet a potential employer and hence it is not possible for average recruitment staff without any domain knowledge to even initiate a conversation which can lead a talent to make a decision to come on the table and explore opportunity.",
    "paragraph2":"While working as a Human Resource Partner with several clients, our founder realized there is huge gap in the talent acquisition market and quality of profiles being presented by existing recruitment and even some top search firms compared to the expectation of their clients. This was only due to lack of domain knowledge and expertise amongst their staff and extended dependency on database acquired through job portals.",
    "paragraph3":"We at Suche Consultants, use research methods like personal networks and knowledge, Social Media, References, Events and attendance list, Proprietary database created through years of collective research and working with Industry Professionals, Head Hunting along with Database acquired through several sources.",
    "paragraph4":"Our best practices have helped us succeed across BFSI domain and simultaneously extended our services and best practice across IT, Manufacturing, BPO/KPO, Medical & Health Care, Hospitality",
    "Why": [
      "Domain and Industry Experts who know the business like Business does",
      "Quicker Onboarding and Hiring Timeline",
      "Cost Effective (Right Talent for the role is extremely cost effective while wrong hires cost a lot in terms of recruitment expenses, training and onboarding, Negative feed in market due to attrition)"
      
    ],
    "Why2": [
      "Cost Effective",
      "Saving Time in Tedious recruitment process",
